	abstract = {This article presents a study on the quality and execution of research code from publicly-available replication datasets at the Harvard Dataverse repository. Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals’ collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognized importance of software architecture, it is common that the implementation diverges from the intended architecture over time. This phenomenon is referred to as architectural drift. In the past decades, mainly technical solutions and tools have been developed to detect and address architectural inconsistencies and drift. There is still a lack of evidence from the perspective of developers and a lack of best practices to manage drift. This mixed-methods study relies on interviews with 11 developers and a survey answered by 63 developers from different companies and domains. We analyzed the data by dividing developers into senior and junior to see the different perspectives based on work experience. We found that juniors tend to rely more on documentation, while seniors have a more experience-related approach. We identified practices that developers use to mitigate drift, including defining clear responsibilities, setting best practices, and maintaining reliable documentation. Finally, we designed and evaluated guidelines to help developers to face architectural drift.},

	abstract = {The Software Engineering Research community has slowly recognized that empirical studies are an important way of validating ideas and increasingly our community has stopped accepting the sufficiency of arguing that a smart person has come up with the idea and therefore it must be good. This has led to a flood of Software Engineering papers that contain at least some form of empirical study. However, not all empirical studies are created equal, and many may not even provide any useful information or value. We survey the gradual shift from essentially no empirical studies, to a small number of ones of questionable value, and look at what we need to do to insure that our empirical studies really contribute to the state of knowledge in the field. Thus we have the good, the bad, and the ugly. What are we as a community doing correctly? What are we doing less well than we should be because we either don't have the necessary artifacts or because the time and resources required to do "the good" is perceived to be too great? And where are we missing the boat entirely in terms of not addressing critical questions and often not even recognizing that these questions are central even if we don't know the answers. We look to see whether we can find some commonality in the projects that have really made the transition from research to widespread practice to see whether we can identify some common themes.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a “modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},
