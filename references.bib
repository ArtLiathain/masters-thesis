	abstract = {Our prior work showed that the majority of error-prone source ﬁles in a software system are architecturally connected. Flawed architectural relations propagate defects among these ﬁles and accumulate high maintenance costs over time, just like debts accumulate interest. We model groups of architecturally connected ﬁles that accumulate high maintenance costs as architectural debts. To quantify such debts, we formally deﬁne architectural debt, and show how to automatically identify debts, quantify their maintenance costs, and model these costs over time. We describe a novel history coupling probability matrix for this purpose, and identify architecture debts using 4 patterns of architectural ﬂaws shown to correlate with reduced software quality. We evaluate our approach on 7 large-scale open source projects, and show that a signiﬁcant portion of total project maintenance eﬀort is consumed by paying interest on architectural debts. The top 5 architectural debts, covering a small portion (8\% to 25\%) of each project’s error-prone ﬁles, capture a signiﬁcant portion (20\% to 61\%) of each project’s maintenance eﬀort. Finally, we show that our approach reveals how architectural issues evolve into debts over time.},

	abstract = {Context:
In scientific software, the inability to reproduce results is often due to technical issues and challenges in recreating the full computational workflow from the original analysis. We conceptualise this problem as Reproducibility Debt (RpD). Much research has been performed to propose solutions to tackle these issues across various computational science disciplines. It is essential to identify and accumulate existing knowledge on reproducibility issues and state-of-the-art solutions so as to provide researchers and practitioners with information that enables further research activities and RpD management in practice.
Objective:
In the context of scientific software, we aim to characterise RpD by providing a taxonomy of issues contributing towards its emergence and identification (causes, effects) and the common solutions discussed in the existing literature.
Method:
We conducted a systematic literature review, considering 2198 studies until January 2024, including 214 primary studies.
Results:
We propose the first taxonomy of RpD items consisting of 37 causes attributed towards its emergence, 63 corresponding effects under seven main categories, and 29 prevention strategies. We also identify 39 specialised tools/frameworks supporting reproducibility.
Conclusion:
The main contributions of this work are (1) a formal definition of RpD; (2) a taxonomy of issues contributing towards RpD; (3) a list of causes and effects having implications for software professionals to identify and measure RpD in their projects; (4) a list of strategies and tools to prevent or remove RpD; (5) the identification of gaps in existing research to guide future studies.},

	abstract = {Context:
The technical debt (TD) metaphor describes actions made during various stages of software development that lead to a more costly future regarding system maintenance and evolution. According to recent studies, on average 25\% of development effort is spent, i.e. wasted, on TD caused issues in software development organizations. However, further research is needed to investigate the relations between various software development activities and TD.
Objective:
The objective of this study is twofold. First, to get empirical insight on the understanding and the use of the TD concept in the IT industry. Second, to contribute towards precise conceptualization of the TD concept through analysis of causes and effects.
Method:
In order to address the research objective a family of surveys was designed as a part of an international initiative that congregates researchers from 12 countries—InsighTD. At country level, national teams ran survey replications with industry practitioners from the respective countries.
Results:
In total 653 valid responses were collected from 6 countries. Regarding the prevalence of the TD concept 22\% of practitioners have only theoretical knowledge about it, and 47\% have some practical experiences with TD identification or management. Further analysis indicated that senior practitioners who work in larger organizations, larger teams, and on larger systems are more likely to be experienced with TD management. Time pressure or deadlinewas the single most cited cause of TD. Regarding the effects of TD: delivery delay, low maintainability, and rework were the most cited.
Conclusion:
InsighTD is the first family of surveys on technical debt in software engineering. It provided a methodological framework that allowed multiple replication teams to conduct research activities and to contribute to a single dataset. Future work will focus on more specific aspects of TD management.},

In essence, they are good modeling tools. Whether they are also good measuring tools depends on how consistently and appropriately they are applied},

	abstract = {This article presents a study on the quality and execution of research code from publicly-available replication datasets at the Harvard Dataverse repository. Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals’ collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognized importance of software architecture, it is common that the implementation diverges from the intended architecture over time. This phenomenon is referred to as architectural drift. In the past decades, mainly technical solutions and tools have been developed to detect and address architectural inconsistencies and drift. There is still a lack of evidence from the perspective of developers and a lack of best practices to manage drift. This mixed-methods study relies on interviews with 11 developers and a survey answered by 63 developers from different companies and domains. We analyzed the data by dividing developers into senior and junior to see the different perspectives based on work experience. We found that juniors tend to rely more on documentation, while seniors have a more experience-related approach. We identified practices that developers use to mitigate drift, including defining clear responsibilities, setting best practices, and maintaining reliable documentation. Finally, we designed and evaluated guidelines to help developers to face architectural drift.},

This has led to a flood of Software Engineering papers that contain at least some form of empirical study. However, not all empirical studies are created equal, and many may not even provide any useful information or value. We survey the gradual shift from essentially no empirical studies, to a small number of ones of questionable value, and look at what we need to do to insure that our empirical studies really contribute to the state of knowledge in the field. Thus we have the good, the bad, and the ugly. What are we as a community doing correctly? What are we doing less well than we should be because we either don't have the necessary artifacts or because the time and resources required to do "the good" is perceived to be too great? And where are we missing the boat entirely in terms of not addressing critical questions and often not even recognizing that these questions are central even if we don't know the answers. We look to see whether we can find some commonality in the projects that have really made the transition from research to widespread practice to see whether we can identify some common themes.},

The effectiveness of a “modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},
