	abstract = {Our prior work showed that the majority of error-prone source ﬁles in a software system are architecturally connected. Flawed architectural relations propagate defects among these ﬁles and accumulate high maintenance costs over time, just like debts accumulate interest. We model groups of architecturally connected ﬁles that accumulate high maintenance costs as architectural debts. To quantify such debts, we formally deﬁne architectural debt, and show how to automatically identify debts, quantify their maintenance costs, and model these costs over time. We describe a novel history coupling probability matrix for this purpose, and identify architecture debts using 4 patterns of architectural ﬂaws shown to correlate with reduced software quality. We evaluate our approach on 7 large-scale open source projects, and show that a signiﬁcant portion of total project maintenance eﬀort is consumed by paying interest on architectural debts. The top 5 architectural debts, covering a small portion (8\% to 25\%) of each project’s error-prone ﬁles, capture a signiﬁcant portion (20\% to 61\%) of each project’s maintenance eﬀort. Finally, we show that our approach reveals how architectural issues evolve into debts over time.},

	abstract = {Context:
In scientific software, the inability to reproduce results is often due to technical issues and challenges in recreating the full computational workflow from the original analysis. We conceptualise this problem as Reproducibility Debt (RpD). Much research has been performed to propose solutions to tackle these issues across various computational science disciplines. It is essential to identify and accumulate existing knowledge on reproducibility issues and state-of-the-art solutions so as to provide researchers and practitioners with information that enables further research activities and RpD management in practice.
Objective:
In the context of scientific software, we aim to characterise RpD by providing a taxonomy of issues contributing towards its emergence and identification (causes, effects) and the common solutions discussed in the existing literature.
Method:
We conducted a systematic literature review, considering 2198 studies until January 2024, including 214 primary studies.
Results:
We propose the first taxonomy of RpD items consisting of 37 causes attributed towards its emergence, 63 corresponding effects under seven main categories, and 29 prevention strategies. We also identify 39 specialised tools/frameworks supporting reproducibility.
Conclusion:
The main contributions of this work are (1) a formal definition of RpD; (2) a taxonomy of issues contributing towards RpD; (3) a list of causes and effects having implications for software professionals to identify and measure RpD in their projects; (4) a list of strategies and tools to prevent or remove RpD; (5) the identification of gaps in existing research to guide future studies.},

	abstract = {Context:
The technical debt (TD) metaphor describes actions made during various stages of software development that lead to a more costly future regarding system maintenance and evolution. According to recent studies, on average 25\% of development effort is spent, i.e. wasted, on TD caused issues in software development organizations. However, further research is needed to investigate the relations between various software development activities and TD.
Objective:
The objective of this study is twofold. First, to get empirical insight on the understanding and the use of the TD concept in the IT industry. Second, to contribute towards precise conceptualization of the TD concept through analysis of causes and effects.
Method:
In order to address the research objective a family of surveys was designed as a part of an international initiative that congregates researchers from 12 countries—InsighTD. At country level, national teams ran survey replications with industry practitioners from the respective countries.
Results:
In total 653 valid responses were collected from 6 countries. Regarding the prevalence of the TD concept 22\% of practitioners have only theoretical knowledge about it, and 47\% have some practical experiences with TD identification or management. Further analysis indicated that senior practitioners who work in larger organizations, larger teams, and on larger systems are more likely to be experienced with TD management. Time pressure or deadlinewas the single most cited cause of TD. Regarding the effects of TD: delivery delay, low maintainability, and rework were the most cited.
Conclusion:
InsighTD is the first family of surveys on technical debt in software engineering. It provided a methodological framework that allowed multiple replication teams to conduct research activities and to contribute to a single dataset. Future work will focus on more specific aspects of TD management.},
